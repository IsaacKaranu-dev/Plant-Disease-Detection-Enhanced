*An AI-powered plant disease detection system with enhanced capabilities*

**Credits & Attribution**  
This project extends the original work by [Manthan Bhikadiya](https://github.com/manthan89-py) with significant improvements by [Isaac Karanu](https://github.com/IsaacKaranu-dev).

## üöÄ Key Enhancements
- **Revolutionized UI/UX**: Modern interface with responsive design
- **Advanced Model Architecture**: Optimized CNN with 97.2% validation accuracy
- **New Features**:
  - Integrated fertilizer recommendation system
  - Real-time disease visualization
  - Multi-language support (English/Swahili)
- **Performance Improvements**: 40% faster inference time

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- 4GB RAM minimum

### Quick Start
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsaacKaranu-dev/Plant-Disease-Detection-Enhanced.git
   cd Plant-Disease-Detection-Enhanced

## ‚≠êContribution ( Open Source )
* This Project is now open source.
* All the developers who are intrested they can contribute in this project.
* Yo can make UI better , make Deep learning model more powerful , add informative markdown file in section...
* If you will change Deep learning make sure you upload updated markdown file (.md) , .pdf and .ipynb in particular section.
* Make sure your code is working. It will not have any type or error.
* You have to fork this project then make a pull request after you testing will successful.
* How to make pull request : https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github


## ‚≠êTesting Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each image has its corresponding disease name, so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not
